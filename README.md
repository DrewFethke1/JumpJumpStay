I made it so either player can die from falling off the edge, which will display their loss in the console. This can change the strategy because now pushing off the edge is a valid strategy.

Players are now able to dash in any direction by pressing either Q or U, depending on the player.

The camera has been moved directly above the map so no player is at a disadvantage because of camera angle.

The map has been made slightly bigger so it looks better in the rectangular camera space.

The changed Game design tools are Goal because you can now try to knock the other person off of the map, Direct action becuase of the Dash and Skill becuse new movement tequniques makes there a larger amount of skill that can be used

Added simple UI to display each players scores and fixed some issues with both players scroing at same time



Added cubes that have rigid body


Added orbs that whn collected increases the players speed by 25% but this is not always good


Added an inventory manager that can track the both of the players scores as well as displaying them
