I made it so either player can die from falling off the edge, which will display their loss in the console. This can change the strategy because now pushing off the edge is a valid strategy.

Players are now able to dash in any direction by pressing either Q or U, depending on the player.

The camera has been moved directly above the map so no player is at a disadvantage because of camera angle.

The map has been made slightly bigger so it looks better in the rectangular camera space.
